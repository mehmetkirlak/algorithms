## :gear: algorithms :gear:
This repository stands for algorithms that I reconstitute.



### List of algorithms:
- Chuck Norris Cipher Encoder:

&emsp; The Chuck Norris code is a unary code, with a single character: zero. The unary code is a conversion of the binary code according
to the sequences of 0 and 1 repeated.

- Amazing Numbers

&emsp; This project contains number algorithms like palindromic, gapful etc. and covers basic operations on integers, as well as with collections.
